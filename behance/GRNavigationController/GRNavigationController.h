 The view controller to be pushed

 The custom transition you want to use (optional, can be nil)
 @param transactionBlock
 Use this to run other animations during the transition (optional, can be NULL)
 @discussion
 Only use this if you need a very specific animation to be performed during the transition,
 if you just want to transition between two controllers, use pushViewController:animated: instead.
